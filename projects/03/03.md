## Memory Devices

- Data Flip-Flop
- Bit
- Register
- RAMn

## Sequential Logic

Until now, time independent chips. To develop memory devices, need to extend gate logic with the ability to respond not only to input changes but also to the ticking of a clock

## Flip-Flops

- chips to remember or store information over time
- Input: in
- Output: out
- Function: out(t+1) = in(t)


## Bit

- a single-bit register

```c
if(load(t)) {
    out(t+1)=in(t);
} else {
    out(t+1)= out(t);
}
```

## Register

- 16-bit register

## RAMn

- aggregate of $n$ `Register`

## Counter

- chip that knows how to increment its value by 1

```c
if (reset(t)) {
    out(t+1) = 0;
} else if (load(t)) {
    out(t+1) = in(t);
} else if (inc(t)) {
    out(t+1) = out(t)+1;
} else {
    out(t+1)=out(t);
}

```
