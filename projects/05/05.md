## Von Neumann Architecture

- Universal Turing Machine (Theoretical) $\Leftrightarrow$ Von Neumann Architecture

- Elements
  - CPU
    - carries out the instructions (control and fetch-execute)
    - ALU
    - Registers
  - Memory
    - holds data and program (sequence of instructions)

- Three basic types of information
  - Control
  - Address
  - Data

## The Fetch-Execute Cycle

- Fetch an instruction
- Execute it
- Repeat

- put the location of the next instruction into the "address" of the program memory
- get the instruction code itself by reading the memory contents at that location
- program counter `PC` has the next instruction
- instruction specifies
  - arithmetic or logical operation
  - memory accesses (read or write)
  - if jumps, to where
- different subsets of the bits control different aspeects of the operation
- executing the operation involves accessing register and/or data memory

- fetch-execute clash
- two-cycle machine
  - fixed with multiplexer
  - in fetch cycle, set the multiplexer to plug into the address input of the memory, the program counter.
  - fetched instruction is stored in instruction register to be used during execution
  - in execute cycle, set the multiplexer to point to data address that needs accesses.

- simpler solution: harvard architecture
  - keep program and data in two separate memory

## CPU

- 16-bit processor
  - execute the current instruction

- inputs
  - `inM` data memory/value
  - `instruction` instruction memory
  - `reset` from user
- outputs
  - `outM` to data memory
  - `writeM` to data memory
  - `addressM` to data memory
  - `pc` to instruction memory

### Instruction handling

- c-instructions
  - op-ode
  - ALU control bits
  - destination load bits
  - jump bits

- a-instructions
  - decodes the instruction into op-code + 15 bit value
  - stores the value in the A-register
  - outputs the value

### ALU

- data inputs
  - from D-register
  - from A-register/M-register

- control inputs
  - control bits from the instruction

- ALU data output
  - fed simulatneously to
    - D-register
    - A-register
    - M-register
  - which register actually received the incoming value is determined by the instruction's destination bits

- ALU control outputs
  - negative?
  - zero?

### Control

- program counter
  - emits the address of the next instruction
  - to start/restart the program's execution: `PC=0`
    - no jump: `PC++`
    - jump: `PC=A` //unconditional goto
    - conditional goto: if the condition is true `PC=A else PC++`

- logic

  ```c
  if (reset==1) 
  {
    PC=0;
  }
  else 
  {
    load = f(jump_bits, ALU_control_outputs);
    if(load==1) {
    PC=A; 
  } else {
    PC++;
  }
  }


  ```

## The Computer

## CPU Operation

- if the instruction includes `D` and `A`, the respective values are read from and/or written to, the CPU-resident `D`-register and `A`-register
- if the instruction is `@x`, then `x` is stored in the `A`-register and the value is emitted by `addressM`
- if the instruction's RHS includes `M`, this value is read from `inM`
- if the instruction's LHS includes `M`, then the ALU output is emitted by the `outM` and the `writeM` bit is asserted

- if(reset==0)
  - cpu logic uses the instruction's jump bits and the ALU's output to decide if there should be jump
  - if there is a jump, `PC=A`
  - updated `PC` value is emitted by `pc`
- if (reset==1)
  - `PC=0`

## Memory

- address: $0-16383$: data memory
- address: $16384-24575$: screen memory map
- address: $24576$: keyboard memory map

### Memory Implementation

- RAM: 16-bit/16K chip
- Screen: 16-bit/8K memory chip with a raster display side-effect
- Keyboard: 16-bit register with a keyboard side-effect

## Instruction Memory (ROM)

- load the program into the ROM
- press reset
- the program starts running

- How to load the program into the ROM?
  - plug-and-play ROM chips
  - hardware simulation

- interface
  - output is the `ROM32K[address]` = current instruction
