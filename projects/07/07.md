## Stack Machine Model

- arithmetic/logical commands

  ```
  add,sub,neg,eq,get,lt,and,or,not,...
  ```

- memory segment commands

    ```
    pop segment i
    push segment i
    ```
- branching commands

    ```
    label label
    goto label
    if-goto label
    ```

- function commands

    ```
    function functionName vVars
    call functionName nArgs
    return
    ```

## Memory

- to store source information about the different types of variables (argument variables, local variables, static variables) or similar
- different types of variables are stored in different memory segments
  - argument (@2)
  - local (@1)
  - static
  - constant
  - this (@3)
  - that (@4)
  - pointer
  - temp

```
push/pop segment i
```

## Implementation

### Stack

- pointer manipulation:

```
D=*p

<=>

@p
A=M
D=M
```


```
*SP=17
SP++

<=>

@17
D=A
@SP
A=M
M=D
@SP
M=M+1
```

```
push constant i

<=>

*SP=i
SP++
```

### Memory Segments

- SP: current location of stack pointer with base address at 256
- LCL: local segment base address stored in LCL

```
pop segment i  // pop stack and store in some segment i

<=>

addr=segmentPtr+i
SP--
*addr=*SP
```

```
push segment i  // pop stack and store in some segment i

<=>

addr=segmentPtr+i
*SP=*addr
SP++
```

- When translating the high-level code of some method into VM code, the compiler
  - maps the method's local and argument variables onto the **local** and **argument** segments
  - maps the object fields and the array entries that the method is currently processing onto the **this** and **that** segments
  - translates high-level operations involving constants into VM operations involving the **constant** segment
    
    ```
    *SP=i
    SP++
    ```

  - maps the static variables that the method sees onto the static segments
    - static variables should be seen by all the methods in a program
    - store them in some global space
      - translate each VM reference `static i` in file `Foo.vm` to assembly reference `Foo.i`
      - these will then be mapped to RAM starting with 16 in order which they appear in the program
    ```
    @Foo.5 // pop
    M=D
    ```
    - `temp` segment is used to store temporary variables
      - 8 variables
      - Mapped on RAM location 5 to 12
    ```
    push temp i  => addr = 5+i;*SP=*addr;SP++
    pop  temp i  => addr = 5+i;SP--;*addr=*SP
    ```
    - generates code that keeps track of the base addresses of the `this` and `that` segments using the `pointer` segment
      - pointer $0$ => `this`
      - pointer $1$ => `that`
    ```
    push pointer 0/1 => *SP=THIS/THAT,SP++
    pop  pointer 0/1 => SP--,THIS/THAT=*SP
    ```
