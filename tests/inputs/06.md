## Assembler

- software layer
- from assembly language to binary/machine language

- Repeat:
  - Read the next command
  - break it into different fields it is composed of
  - lookup the binary code for each field
  - combine these codes into a single machine language command
  - output machine language command
- Until eof

## Assembly Process

- Must handle
  - Whitespace
  - Instructions
  - Symbols

### Handling Instructions

- **A-Instruction**
  - if value is decimal constant generate, the equivalent 15-bit constant
  - if value is symbol, later

```asm
@value = 0valueInBinary
```

- **C-Instruction**

```
dest=comp;jump = 1 1 1 a c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 d1 d2 d3 j1 j2 j3

MD=D+1 = 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
```

### Handling Symbols

- Symbols
  - Variable symbols
    - represent memory locations where the programmer wants to maintain values
  - Label symbols
    - represent destinations of goto instructions
  - Pre-defined symbols
    - represent special memory locations
    - R0,R1,SCREEN,KBD,...
    - 23 pre-defined symbol

|Symbol|Value|Symbol|Value|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|R0|0|SP|0|
|R1|1|LCL|1|
|..|..|ARG|2|
|R15|15|THIS|3|
|SCREEN|16384|THAT|4|
|KBD|24576| | |

- `@preDefinedSymbol`
  - replace `preDefinedSymbol` with its value
- Label symbols
  - used to denote destinations of goto
  - declared by pseudo-command (XXX)
  - defines the symbol XXX to refer to the memory location holding the next instruction in the program.
  - `@labelSymbol`
    - replace `labelSymbol` with its value
- Variable Symbols
  - any symbol xxx appearing in an assembly program which is not pre-defined and is not defined elsewhere using the (XXX) directive is treated as a variable
  - each variable is assigned a unique memory address, starting at $16$
  - `@variableSymbol`
    - seeing for the first time, assign a unique memory address
    - replace `variableSymbol` with its value

### Symbol Table

|Symbol|Value|
|:-:|:-:|
|   |   |

- first empty
- populate it with predefined symbols
- look for label declaration counting only the real line numbers

## Alogrithm

- Prepare Symbol Table
- First Pass (Label)
- Second Pass (Variable and Instruction)

## Software Architecture

- reading and parsing commands
- converting mnemonics -> code
- handling symbols

- Parser
- Code
- SymbolTable
- Main
